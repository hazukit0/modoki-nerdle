# modoki-nerdle

This is my first project with React. Yay!<br>
I plan to make something nerdle-like.

â€» Please let me know if there are any copyright or other issues. I will remove this.

Demo is [here](https://hazukit0.github.io/modoki-nerdle/).

First of all, I made the front.

## Getting started

This is React project. <br>
Node.js version: 18.4.0

If you want to run it on your pc, as shown below

    cd [project-folder]
    npm install

If you have not installed yarn, it is useful to do so.

    npm install --global yarn


## Future Work
- Create the logo
- Color the numeric control panel
- Create a callout for game message
- Pop-up dialog
- Consider the server-side logic. (Whether data should be placed in local storage or server-side)
- Separation of server-side and front-end logic
